                <p align="justify">Cyber crime also known as  computer crime  is the use of a computer as an instrument 
                to further illegal ends, such as committing fraud, trafficking in child pornography and intellectual 
                property, stealing identities, or violating privacy.<br /><br />What distinguishes cyber crime from the 
                traditional crime is that, cyber crime is commisted through a computer. Cybercrime, especially involving 
                the internet, represents an extension of existing criminal behaviour alongside some novel illegal activities.<br /><br />
                The most distinct nature of cyber crime from traditional one is that it&rsquo;s borderless and anonymous. By the help of 
                pervasive network technology, cyber crime is ramping over areas, regions, and countries. For investigators, it&rsquo;s really
                 hard to get the true picture of the whole crime process because of dispersed elements in different places. <br /><br />
                 Most cybercrime is an attack on information about individuals, corporations, or governments. Although the attacks 
                 do not take place on a physical body, they do take place on the personal or corporate virtual body, which is the set 
                 of informational attributes that define people and institutions on the internet. <br /><br />The use of internet and the 
                 number of users have significantly increased over the past few decades. Given the present growth rate of Internet and 
                 the ever changing scenario, numerous legal issues arise. One of the most important issues concerning cyberspace today 
                 is that of Cybercrimes.<br /></p>

                 Cyber crimes in social networking sites have become easy target for cyber criminals to commit cyber crimes. Criminals are finding new ways to utilize such sites to commit new and disturbing crimes that authorities don't necessarily know how to tackle. 
Some of the most prevalent cyber crimes in present social networking (Facebook) world are as follows:<br/><br/>

    <h4 align="center">Scams</h4>
</div> 

Scams<br/>
Criminals have been utilizing the scam for centuries. In the Facebook world, scams are particularly effective at drawing people in by simply enticing an individual to click on a link that would interest almost anyone, such as an innocent-looking notification that you've won a free prize like a gift card. Then, in order to claim the prize, scammers require you to submit some information, such as a credit card number or Social Security number. This description may make it seem like scams are easy to spot, but even the most savvy social media user has to be on the lookout for illegitimate requests for information.

<br/><br/><br/>Cyberbullying<br/>
<div class="img-container" style="width: 200px; float: left;">
    <img src="images/cyber bullying.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=200 height=150/>
    <h4 align="center">Cyber Bullying</h4>
</div><br/><br/><br/>
Cyberbullying is a common occurrence among teenagers on Facebook and one that can result in serious criminal charges if it goes far enough. Cyberbullying on Facebook has contributed to the deaths of several teens who either committed suicide or were killed by a peer. Cyberbullying that involves hacking or password and identity theft may be punishable under state and federal law. When adults engage in this kind of online behavior it is called cyber-harassment or cyberstalking.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>Stalking<br/>
<div class="img-container" style="width: 200px; float: left;">
    <img src="images/stalking.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=200 height=150/>
    <h4 align="center">Stalking</h4>
</div><br/>
The term "stalking" is thrown around a lot on Facebook, and it is often meant as a joke for regularly looking at someone's profile. However, the actual act of cyberstalking is a common crime on the social networking site and can result in a serious offense. Cyberstalking typically involves harassing a person with messages, written threats, and other persistent online behavior that endangers a person's safety. Although cyberstalking may seem like nothing more than annoying behavior, it is a legitimate cause for concern in many cases and can even lead to in-person stalking or endangerment if not treated seriously.

    <h4 align="center">Robbery</h4>
</div>
<br/><br/>Robbery<br/>
It doesn't take much for a thief to find out where you live, go to school, work, or hang out if you make that information readily available on Facebook. If you use Facebook's check-in or Google Maps feature, then you could be in a heap of trouble if a robber is paying attention. This person isn't always a complete stranger either; they may be an old acquaintance or someone else you'd never expect to come rob you.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>Identity theft<br/>
<div class="img-container" style="width: 200px; float: left;">
    <img src="images/identity theft.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=200 height=150/>
    <h4 align="center">Identity Theft</h4>
</div><br/>
With the large amount of personal information swarming around Facebook these days, it has become fairly easy for criminals to steal users' identities. Hackers often break into users' e-mails and make fake Facebook accounts. From there they can access personal and bank information and cause havoc to your sense of security. Protect yourself from identity theft on Facebook by keeping your profile very secure and free of personal information that a criminal would love to have.

<br/><br/><br/><br/><div class="img-container" style="width: 195px; float: right;">
    <img src="images/defamation.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=195 height=140/>
    <h4 align="center">Defamation</h4>
</div>
<br/><br/>Defamation<br/>
An individual commits the crime of defamation when they communicate a false statement to a third party that paints another individual or entity in a negative light. Facebook makes communicating defamatory statements frighteningly easy, and the exposure Facebook provides makes it more likely that businesses or individuals will be harmed by the defamatory statement, and thus more likely to pursue legal remedies. Be careful what you say on Facebook; you may be committing a crime without even knowing it.

</div><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Harassment<br/>
Harassment happens all the time on Facebook. From sexual harassment to assault threats, there has been a significant increase in the number of harassment cases happening on Facebook. It's not uncommon for sex offenders and sexual predators to prey on unsuspecting victims on Facebook and even pose as a teen or college student. Harassing messages, inappropriate comments, and other persistent behaviors should be reported to Facebook and your local police station.<br/><br/>

    <img src="images/social engineering.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=150 height=150/>
    <h4 align="center">Social Engineering</h4>
</div>
Social engineering<br/>

Unlike the physical world, individuals can misrepresent everything about themselves while they communicate online, ranging not only from their names and business affiliations (something that is fairly easy to do in-person as well), but extending as well to their gender, age, and location (identifiers that are far more difficult to fake in-person). These types of "con-artists" can now be referred to as being engaged in social engineering.  Con artists are able to conduct identity theft crimes by misidentifying themselves on social networking sites and then tricking their victims into giving them their account names and passwords as well as other personally identifiable information.

<br/><br/><br/>Fraud schemes<br/>
<div class="img-container" style="width: 150px; float: left;">
    <img src="images/fraud schemes.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=150 height=150/>
    <h4 align="center">Fraud Schemes</h4>
</div><br/><br/><br/>
Fraud schemes are generally conducted by cyber criminals after gaining  access to other accounts. The person then engages in spreading misleading information to the original account holder's friends and contacts to trick them into providing him with valuable information.


<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Phishing scams<br/>
<div class="img-container" style="width:225px; float: right;">
    <img src="images/phishing scams.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=225 height=300/>
    <h4 align="center">Phishing Scams</h4>
</div>
Phishing schemes attempt to make Internet users believe that they are receiving e-mail from a trusted source when that is not the case. Phishing attacks on social networking site users come in various formats, including: messages within the social networking site either from strangers or compromised friend accounts; links or videos within a social networking site profile claiming to lead to something harmless that turns out to be harmful; or e-mails sent to users claiming to be from the social networking site itself.

Social networking site users fall victim to the schemes due to the higher level of trust typically displayed while using social networking sites.

Users often accept into their private sites people that they do not actually know, or sometimes fail altogether to pproperly set privacy settings on their profile. This gives cyber thieves an advantage when trying to trick their victims through various phishing schemes.
Social networking sites, as well as corporate websites in general, provide criminals with enormous amounts of information to send official looking documents and send them to individual targets who have shown interest in specific subjects.

The personal and detailed nature of the information erodes the victim's sense of caution, leading them to open the malicious e-mail. Such e-mail contains an attachment that contains malicious software designed to provide the e-mail's sender with control over the victim's entire computer.

Once the malware infection is discovered, it is often too late to protect the data from compromise.

Cyber criminals design advanced malware to act with precision to infect, conceal access, steal or modify data without detection. Coders of advanced malware are patient and have been known to test a network and its users to evaluate defensive responses.

Advanced malware may use a "layered" approach to infect and gain elevated privileges on a system. Usually, these types of attacks are bundled with an additional cyber crime tactic, such as social engineering or zero day exploits.

In the first phase of a malware infection, a user might receive a spear phishing e-mail that obtains access to the user's information or gains entry into the system under the user's credentials. Once the cyber criminal initiates a connection to the user or system, they can further exploit it using other vectors that may give them deeper access to system resources.

In the second phase, the hacker might install a backdoor to establish a persistent presence on the network that can no longer be discovered through the use of anti-virus software or firewalls.


<br/><br/><div class="img-container" style="width: 195px; float: right;">
    <img src="images/data mining.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=195 height=195/>
    <h4 align="center">Data Mining</h4>
</div>
Data mining<br/>
Cyber thieves use data mining on social networking sites as a way to extract sensitive information about their victims. This can be done by criminal actors on either a large or small scale by means such as sending out quizzes or questionnaires to a group of people .  While the answers to these questions do not appear to be malicious on the surface, they often mimic the same questions that are asked by financial institutions or e-mail account providers when an individual has forgotten their password. The victims, unaware of the risks, may answer these questions and put his sensitive information at risk.


<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The cyber underground<br/>
<div class="img-container" style="width: 195px; float: right;">
    <img src="images/cyber underground.jpg" alt="" border=0 width=195 height=195/>
    <h4 align="center">Cyber Underground</h4>
</div>
The potential for considerable profits is enticing to young criminals, and has resulted in the creation of a large underground economy known as the cyber underground.
The cyber underground is a pervasive market governed by rules and logic that closely mimic those of the legitimate business world, including a unique language, a set of expectations about its members' conduct, and a system of stratification based on knowledge and skill, activities and reputation.
One of the ways that cyber criminals communicate within the cyber underground is on website forums.
It is on these forums that cyber criminals buy and sell login credentials (such as those for e-mail, social networking sites, or financial accounts); where they buy and sell phishing kits, malicious software, access to botnets; and victim social security numbers, credit cards, and other sensitive information.
These criminals are increasingly professionalized, organized, and have unique or specialized skills.
In addition, cyber crime is increasingly transnational in nature, with individuals living in different countries around the world working together on the same schemes.<br/><br/>

One can be certain that social networking sites mainly Facebook, has become a part of almost every Nepali citizen with access to computers and internet. There is rarely any youngster who does not use facebook.  And with this the risks of being victims to cyber crimes has increased by a substantial amount. Also this makes it easier for criminals to target and torment their prey.<br/>
Identity thefts, cyber bullying, fraud schemes, forwarding of misleading information, etc can be some of the most prominent crimes that are occurring here in this country.<br/>
These cyber crimes are mostly commited through facebook since it has the most craze amongst other social networking sites among the Nepali net users. Offence over Facebook has outrun all other forms of reported cyber crime in Nepal, police records have shown.<br/>
Forty-seven cases of cyber crime have been registered and delved into by the police since mid-2008. Thirty-one of them were about the misuse of, and crisis created on Facebook.<br/>
